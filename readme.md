Due Date: December 28th, 2016

Implemented a bounding-box classification system that uses the bag-of-words approach, and applying it to the MSRC v1 dataset, which
contains 240 images with 13 classes. 
1. First, take responses of a filter bank on images, and build a dictionary of visual words.
2. Then, learn a model for the visual world based on a bag of visual words, and use nearest-neighbor to predict object classes in a test set. Specifically predicting the class or label (e.g., \car") of the object contained by a user-selected bounding-box (rectangle).
3. Finally, try to improve the performance of your algorithm via a number of different ways.
